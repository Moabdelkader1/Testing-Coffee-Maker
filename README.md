CoffeeMaker Cucumber
====================
In this project I have generated tests directly from user stories using Cucumber & Gherkin on the coffee maker project, I have tested many different scenarios in order to efficiently apply integration testing to the whole project. The coffee maker allows you to set up recipes, add ingredients, and to make one of several beverages, provided that you insert enough money. I have also used jacoco which is a tool that generate test reports indicating code coverage. 
My code will be found in src/test.
