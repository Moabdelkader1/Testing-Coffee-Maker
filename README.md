CoffeeMaker Cucumber
====================
In this project I have generated tests directly from user stories using Cucumber & Gherkin on the coffee maker project. The coffee maker allows you to set up recipes, add ingredients, and to make one of several beverages, provided that you insert enough money. I have also used jacoco which generate test reports indicating code coverage by Cucumber tests to cover as much parts of the code as possible, my code will be found in src/test.
